# IntelliJ to VSCode configuration converter
### Build using Java:tm: and managed through Maven
This project is simple cli utility that I wrote to deal with converting IntelliJ runConfigurations to VSCodes launch.json.

### Features
- Reads in a folder of xml files filled with Intellij runConfigurations (the runConfigurations folder within .idea)
- Parses the xml using JAXB and an autogenerated JAXB class
- Writes a launch.json file to the current working directory

### Gripes and Improvements
- [x] Sort JSON
  - ~~Currently the launch.json output is seemingly random and unsorted, which affects the order that configurations show up in the run debug options~~
- [ ] Refactor code to be more readable
  - [ ] Fix the depth of nesting and lack of documentation
- [x] Figure out compatibility with Java 17+
  - ~~Currently only running properly in Java 8~~
  - Turned out to be use of old maven dependencies which did some bytecode optimization that caused warnings and breakages in later versions of java
- [ ] Add a better way to add the utility to path
  - [x] Currently creating an alias in .zshrc and pointing the alias to a java classpath of the jar file
- Consider writing a JUnit test?

### Usage
Usage: intellijtovscode ./path-to-runConfigurations --module ModuleName
	  --module ModuleName    this flag will override the runConfigurations default module name with the ModuleName provided.

Example Usage: intellijtovscode '.idea/runConfigurations' --module BFSPuzzleSolver
